## What is a Programming Paradigm?

- Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized. 
- Each paradigm consists of certain structures, features, and opinions about how common programming problems should be tackled.

The question of why are there many different programming paradigms is similar to why are there many programming languages. Certain paradigms are better suited for certain types of problems, so it makes sense to use different paradigms for different kinds of projects.



Also, the practices that make up each paradigm have developed through time. Thanks to the advances both in software and hardware, different approaches have come up that 

didn't exist before.



And last to think, there's human creativity. As a species, we just like creating things, improving what others have built in the past, and adapting tools to our preference or to what seems more efficient to us.



All this results in the fact that today we have many options to choose from when we want to write and structure a given program. 



Conclusion:

Programming paradigms are different ways in which we can face programming problems, and organize our code.

Imperative, procedural, functional, declarative, and object oriented paradigms are some of the most popular and widely used paradigms today. And knowing the basics about them is good for general knowledge and also for better understanding other topics of the coding world.
